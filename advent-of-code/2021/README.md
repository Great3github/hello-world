## Boilerplates

December 1, in preparation for day 2

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
l = document.body.textContent.trim().split(/\r?\n/) // owo
.map(Number)
```

December 2: I put the `.trim()` stuff on a new line so I could easily comment
out `document.body.textContent` to put in an example input.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
l = document.body.textContent
.trim().split(/\r?\n/) // owo v2
.map(Number)
```

December 13: I set up an anonymous function for `Array#map` since it seems the
inputs aren't just a list of numbers anymore. This way, I can also easily use it
as a for loop if I'd like.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
lines = document.body.textContent
.trim().split(/\r?\n/) // owo v3
.map(line => {
return +line
})
```

December 14: More and more of the days have chunks separated by two newlines, so
I decided to group up `\r?\n` with a noncapturing group with a quantifier. I
probably could just do with `\n\n` since Advent of Code uses LF, but whatever. I
also put a semicolon before `lines` in case I wanted to do an array destructure,
though in most cases I don't have any lines before it so it's usually not
needed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
;lines = document.body.textContent
.trim().split(/(?:\r?\n){1}/) // owo v4
.map(line => {
return +line
})
```

December 21: I made the input page dark theme for my eyes' convenience. I also
set up the array destructure ahead of time, as well as added some indentation so
it at least starts off looking tolerable.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
document.documentElement.style.colorScheme = 'dark' // ðŸ¥°
;[...lines] = document.body.textContent
  .trim().split(/(?:\r?\n){1}/) // owo v5
  .map(line => {
    return +line
  })
```
