# Random item skyblock datapack

Gives a random item to each player (each player gets a different item). The items are enchanted randomly.

You can change how often it gives the item. After enabling the datapack, run

```mcfunction
scoreboard players set Interval random_board [delay]
reload
```

where `[delay]` is the time between each item in ticks (1 second = 20 ticks). By default it is 600 ticks (30 seconds).

I recommend playing on a void world with an oak tree on a dirt block at (0, 64, 0).
