[slicedlime/examples](https://github.com/slicedlime/examples) has a vanilla\_worldgen.zip file that makes it hard to see differences between versions.

This aims to unzip it and recreate the commit history.

To start, run in this directory,

```sh
./init
```

Afterwards, and whenever there's a new update, do

```sh
./unzip-history
```

I've done this and pushed the result to [SheepTester/vanilla-worldgen](https://github.com/SheepTester/vanilla-worldgen).

I did not get prior permission to republish the zipped file on [slicedlime/examples](https://github.com/slicedlime/examples) and will take down that repository when asked.
