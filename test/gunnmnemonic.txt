This is one way you can remember the normal Gunn schedule.
Focus on the periods before lunch first.
Fill in the periods A through E in order, going back to A after E.
Brunch is after the first period of each day.
For the first four days, F and G alternate after lunch.
There is both F and G on Friday.
On the even number days, or Tuesday and Thursday, or the days starting with T, or the days with the last two A periods or the first G periods, or however you want to remember it, flex goes right after lunch.
Psych! Gunn only wants the most attentive students, so they swapped A period with flex.
They also flipped E and flex on Tuesday so people donâ€™t get hungry before lunch and eat food during flex.
On weeks with only four days, just take the Monday and Tuesday schedules, remove the Tuesday A period, and repeat it twice.
Down with SELF.
