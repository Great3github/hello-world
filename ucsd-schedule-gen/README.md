## theory.

for this 2 pass system, i have the following classes planned:

- ece 35 - required to apply for ece ce major
  - first pass
- cat 2 - required for GEs, this year only available this quarter
  - would like nguyen ideally; bronstein is good too. I can tolerate any
    teacher, but I would like it to be compatible with my times
  - first pass
- cse 12/15l - ideally, eventually for major, but will probably fill up by
  second pass
- lign 7 - satisfies DEI and Sixth social analysis GEs
- math 20d - if I do not get into cse, then i'll probably take this

I already have a schedule planned, but this kind of explains how I want to
specify my classes for a schedule generator

also, here are the criteria to consider:

- professor ratings
  - i personally do not care, even if my current cat 1 prof is boring
